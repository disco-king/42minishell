# 42minishell

This repository contains my take on the Minishell 42 learning project.
The goal of the project is to create a fully functional bash-like terminal that can call progams from system's binary directories or any given path, create pipelines and handle things like file redirections, environment variable creation and use, signals etc.

Overall, this project is a very good excersise that helps you understand the logic of UNIX-like systems and build software that works well with them.

The Makefile provided in the root folder should produce a working binary on Mac and Linux systems provided it can find the readline library.
